# Thermolab: Thermodynamics in MATLAB
## Introduction
Thermolab is developed to perform thermodynamics calculations coupled to open system processes. It exists of a set of Matlab codes that can be used to calculate Gibbs energy and make phase diagrams to be used in lookup tables for coupling in transport codes.
