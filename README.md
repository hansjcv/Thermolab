# Thermolab
Thermodynamics in MATLAB

Download the files, Example_1.m, tl_gibbs_energy.p, and tl_dataset.mat and put them in the same folder.
Open MATLAB and run the Example_1.m file from the editor.

To do calculations with different endmembers, load tl_dataset and type phs_names in the command window to see all possible phases. The composition of each phase can be found in the variable 'nphs'. Currently, only phases with the suffix 'tc-ds55' are implemented.
