## Welcome to the Thermolab pages

Thermolab is a thermodynamics laboratory to do modelling of coupled non-equilibrium processes.

You can download p-coded MATLAB files for the main Thermolab functions. They will be published as m-files after the Thermolab publication is accepted. The examples are available as m-files.
